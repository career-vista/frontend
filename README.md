# CareerVista AI - Frontend

A React-based career guidance application for Indian students with AI-powered insights and college predictions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- A backend API server running (see backend repository)

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the environment template
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Edit the `.env` file with your actual values:**
   ```env
   # Google OAuth Configuration
   VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
   
   # API Configuration
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
   ```

### Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth Client ID from Google Cloud Console | `123456789-abc.apps.googleusercontent.com` |
| `VITE_API_URL` | Backend server base URL (without /api suffix) | `http://localhost:8080` (dev) or `https://api.yourdomain.com` (prod) |

### Getting Google OAuth Client ID

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API
4. Go to "Credentials" in the left sidebar
5. Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth client ID"
6. Choose "Web application"
7. Add your domain to authorized origins
8. Copy the Client ID to your `.env` file

### Development

```bash
# Option 1: Start with environment variables (Recommended)
pnpm run dev:env

# Option 2: Set environment variables manually and start
$env:VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"; $env:VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:8080"; pnpm dev

# Option 3: Use .env.local file (create it first)
pnpm dev

# The app will be available at http://localhost:3000
```

**Note:** Due to Vite's environment variable loading behavior on Windows, we recommend using `pnpm run dev:env` or setting environment variables manually for the most reliable development experience.

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build the application
pnpm build

# Preview the production build
pnpm preview
```

### Project Structure

## üîí Security Notes

- Always use environment variables for sensitive data
- The `dist/` folder is ignored by git as it may contain embedded secrets
